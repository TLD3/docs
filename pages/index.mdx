# TLD3

Welcome to TLD3 documentation.

## What is TLD3

TLD3 is a dApp that bridges domains with Web3 ecosystem on Doma Network. We are aiming for an ecosystem of decentralized tools that will allow users to trade and utilize their domains in Web3.

At the moment, we have domain derivative trading on TLD3, which is built on Doma Network. We are working on a domain auction platform, and a Web3 domain backordering algorithm.

### Web Platform

Start trading on [tld3.app](https://tld3.app).
